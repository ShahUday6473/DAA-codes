'''
Huffman Encoding is a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression. The algorithm follows a greedy strategy by
repeatedly merging the two least frequent nodes to create an optimal binary tree, known as the Huffman Tree.

A **greedy algorithm** is a problem-solving strategy that builds a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next 
step that offers the **most immediate benefit** or **optimal local choice**. It does this without worrying about how 
the choice will affect the overall solution.

### Key Characteristics of Greedy Algorithms:
1. **Local Optimization**: At each step, it makes the best choice available at that moment.
2. **Irrevocable Decisions**: Once a choice is made, itâ€™s never reconsidered.
3. **Efficiency**: Greedy algorithms are often faster and simpler since they don't explore all possible solutions.

### Example:
In **Huffman Encoding**, a greedy approach is used by repeatedly combining the two nodes with the lowest frequency 
until only one node remains. This creates an optimal tree structure for data compression.
