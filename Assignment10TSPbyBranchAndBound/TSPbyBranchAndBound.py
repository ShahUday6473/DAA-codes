'''
Why Branch and Bound?
Efficient Search: TSP is a combinatorial optimization problem with a factorial time complexity for brute-force 
solutions, making it computationally expensive for large inputs. Branch and Bound systematically explores paths and 
prunes paths that canâ€™t yield optimal results, reducing the solution space.
Bounding Strategy: By computing lower bounds using minimum edge costs, the algorithm can eliminate many suboptimal 
paths early in the search process.
Optimal Solution: Branch and Bound guarantees finding the optimal solution (unlike heuristic approaches) by 
exhaustively exploring paths within the bounds.
This approach is ideal for TSP when exact solutions are required for small to medium problem sizes, balancing accuracy 
and efficiency through systematic pruning.
